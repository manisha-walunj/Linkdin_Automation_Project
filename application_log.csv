Company Summary:

Ceevra is a San Francisco-based, medical software company that helps surgeons (mainly cancer surgeons) plan and operate better through advanced imaging. We take standard CT scans and MRIs and transform them into brilliant, interactive 3D digital models which are viewed by surgeons from their mobile phones, tablets, or through robotic surgery platforms. We help surgeons determine the best type of operation to perform and the best way to perform it – resulting in faster operations, reduced hospital stay, saved organs, and reduced cancer recurrence. A quick explainer video: https://vimeo.com/1007811704




Ceevra's product is FDA-cleared and CE-marked and has been the centerpiece of two successful, multi-center, randomized clinical trials. Our customers include two of the ten largest health systems in the country, and several leading academic medical centers. We are privately held, and our team is highly cohesive and collaborative.




We offer candidates the unique opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and a product that helps improve surgical outcomes and the quality of life for cancer patients, while doing so at a startup that serves some of the country's most innovative medical centers.

Improve deployment automation and cloud architecture management
Contribute to test automation frameworks (unit-level, component-level, and system/end-to-end) and quality metrics

Strong ability to code in Python, JavaScript and modern development practices is required
Problem-solving skills and comfort with independent work is required
Experience with django, react.js, and react-native is highly valued
Prior full-time, full-stack engineering experience in a corporate environment is highly valued
Basic understanding of cloud services (AWS, GCP, or Azure) is a plus
Working knowledge of containerization, infrastructure-as-code concepts and tools like Terraform and/or Docker is a plus
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices is a plus
BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, engineering, or relevant scientific field is required




Bonus Skills:

Any of these would make a candidate stand out:

Experience with medical imaging (especially CT and MRI)
Experience automating tests at multiple levels (unit, integration/component, system)
Experience and aptitude working with ML and ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow
Experience with quality engineering of medical devices (ISO 13485, FDA QSR, IEC 62304)
Experience with computer graphics
