Job Description:

The next evolution of AI-powered cyber defense is here.

With the rise of cloud and modern technologies, organizations struggle with the vast amount of data and thereby security alerts generated by their existing security tools. Cyberattacks continue to get more sophisticated and harder to detect in the sea of alerts and false positives. According to the Forrester 2023 Enterprise Breach Benchmark Report, a security breach costs organizations an average of $3M and takes organizations over 200 days to investigate and respond.




AiStrike’s platform aims to reduce the time to investigate and respond to threats by over 90%. Our approach is to leverage the power of AI and machine learning to adopt an attacker mindset to prioritize and automate cyber threat investigation and response. The platform reduces alerts by 100:5 and provides detailed context and link analysis capabilities to investigate the alert. The platform also provides collaborative workflow and no code automation to cut down the time to respond to threats significantly.




If you have the desire to join the next evolution of cyber defense, are willing to work hard and learn fast, and be part of building something special, this is the company for you. We are seeking a passionate and experienced Python and Java engineer to join our growing team and play a key role in building and maintaining scalable, secure, and performant backend systems.




Roles and Responsibilities:

Design, develop, and implement secure and robust backend web applications using Python, Java, and relevant frameworks (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Spring Boot).
Leverage microservices architecture deployed in Kubernetes for enhanced scalability and performance.
Utilize expertise in Docker containers to package and deploy applications efficiently.
Demonstrate strong cloud computing experience with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or similar platforms.
Design and build connector frameworks for seamless integration with security and cloud platforms.
Work with various database systems (SQL, NoSQL) and apply data modeling practices effectively.
Implement best practices in software development, design patterns, and security principles.
Automate tasks and processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.
Collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams (backend, frontend, DevOps).
Identify and proactively address security challenges within the systems.
Continuously learn and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the Python, Java, and microservices ecosystems.
Contribute to DevOps practices and tools (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines).
Leverage experience with Neo4j or similar graph databases.







Skills and Qualifications:

5+ years of experience as a Python and Java engineer with a solid understanding of the languages and best practices.
Extensive experience with frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and Spring Boot for building web applications.
Deep familiarity with microservices architecture and deployment in Kubernetes.
Proficient in Docker containerization and container orchestration tools.
Proven experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or similar.
Experience building connector frameworks for security and cloud integrations.
